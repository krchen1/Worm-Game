# Worm-Game
Worm Game in LC3. Worm game that takes 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' inputs for movement and 'r', 'g', 
'b', 'y', and 'space' inputs to manually change the worm's color. The worm's color also changes every 
5 moves. The worm can't move outside the display's border. 'Enter' clears the screen and resets 
the worm's location to the center of the screen and 'q' stops the program. The programs outputs
“WORMS CAN’T LEAVE!” if the user tries to worm past the edge of the screen.
